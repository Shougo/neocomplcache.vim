INTRODUCTION					*neocomplcache-introduction*

*neocomplcache* performs keyword completion by making a cash of keyword in
buffer. Because I implemented it by paying own expenses unlike the keyword
completion including the Vim composing type, neocomplcache can be customized
flexibly. Unfortunately neocomplcache may use more memory than other
plugins.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*neocomplcache-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neocomplcache-commands*

:NeoComplCacheEnable					*:NeoComplCacheEnable*
		Validate neocomplcache and initialize it.
		Warning: Conventional cash disappears.

:NeoComplCacheDisable					*:NeoComplCacheDisable*
		Invalidate neocomplcache and clean it up.

:NeoComplCacheToggle					*:NeoComplCacheToggle*
		Change a lock state of neocomplcache.
		While locking neocomplcache, automatic completion is not
		possible.

:Neco 							*:Neco*
		Secret.

:NeoComplCacheLock					*:NeoComplCacheLock*
		Lock neocomplcache.
		While locking neocomplcache, manual completion is possible.
		The lock status is buffer local.

:NeoComplCacheUnLock					*:NeoComplCacheUnLock*
		Unlock neocomplcache.

:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength			*:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength*
		Change start length of automatic completion.

:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer*
		Caching [bufname] buffer.  Warning: considerably take time,
		for the big buffer.  Select current buffer when [bufname]
		omitted.  When [bufname] buffer is not cashed, perform only
		simple cashing.

:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax [filetype]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax*
		Caching [filetype] syntax file.
		Select current buffer filetype when [filetype] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingDisable [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingDisable*
		Disable [bufname] buffer's cache.
		The cache will be deleted.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingEnable [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingEnable*
		Enable [bufname] buffer's cache.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCachePrintSource [bufname]			*:NeoComplCachePrintSource*
		Output [bufname] buffer's cache in current buffer.

		For a command for debugging, a user will not need to use it mainly.

:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword*
		Write the keyword which cashed [bufname] buffer in current
		buffer.  Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.  When
		you make a dictionary file by yourself, it may be
		convenient.

		Create tags from [bufname] buffer.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets [filetype]			*:NeoComplCacheEditSnippets*
		Edit [filetype] snippets.  Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted.  When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly.  This
		command edits a snippet file in g:NeoComplCache_SnippetsDir
		with precedence.  It is done re-cash automatically when you
		store a snippet file.

:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets [filetype]			*:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets*
		Edit [filetype] snippets. Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted. When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly. This

		snippets when [filetype] omitted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*neocomplcache-variables*

g:NeoComplCache_EnableAtStartup				*g:NeoComplCache_EnableAtStartup*
		This variable controls whether I validate neocomplcache at
		the time of Vim start.  This option should set it in .vimrc.
	
		Because default value is 0, you cannot use neocomplcache
		unless you validate it by manual operation.

g:NeoComplCache_MaxList					*g:NeoComplCache_MaxList*
		This variable controls the number of candidates displayed in
		a pop-up menu.  The case beyond this value is cut down a
		candidate.
	
		Default value is 100.

g:NeoComplCache_MaxKeywordWidth				*g:NeoComplCache_MaxKeywordWidth*
		This variable controls the indication width of a candidate
		displayed in a pop-up menu.  The case beyond this value is
		cut down properly.
	
		Default value is 50.

g:NeoComplCache_MaxFilenameWidth			*g:NeoComplCache_MaxFilenameWidth*
		This variable controls the indication width of a file name

		at the time of key input automatically.
	
		Default value is 2.

g:NeoComplCache_ManualCompletionStartLength		*g:NeoComplCache_ManualCompletionStartLength*
		This variable controls the number of the input completioning
		at the time of manual completion.  It is convenient when you
		reduce this value, but may get heavy when you deleted a
		letter in <C-h> or <BS> at popup indication time.
	
		Default value is 2.

g:NeoComplCache_MinKeywordLength			*g:NeoComplCache_MinKeywordLength*
		In a buffer or dictionary files, this variable controls
		length of keyword becoming the object of the completion at
		the minimum.
	
		Default value is 4.

		This variable defines calculation time to cancel automatic
		completion by a second unit.  This optional value must be
		character string.
	
		Default value is '0.2'.

g:NeoComplCache_EnableCamelCaseCompletion		*g:NeoComplCache_EnableCamelCaseCompletion*
		When you input a capital letter, this variable controls

		open file is bigger than this size, neocomplcache do not
		make a cash.
	
		Default value is 1000000.

g:NeoComplCache_CachingDisablePattern			*g:NeoComplCache_CachingDisablePattern*
		This variable set a pattern of the buffer name which does
		not make a cash of a buffer in regular expression.  When it
		is an empty character string, it becomes invalid.
	
		Default value is ''.

g:NeoComplCache_SnippetsDir				*g:NeoComplCache_SnippetsDir*
		This variable appoints the pass of the snippet files which
		user defined.  It cuts the directory by plural appointment
		in comma separated value.  When there is not the directory
		which appointed here, neocomplcache will ignore.  User
		defined snippet files are read after having read a normal
		snippet files.  It is overwritten redundant snippet.
	
		There is not this variable unless a user defines it by oneself.

g:NeoComplCache_TemporaryDir				*g:NeoComplCache_TemporaryDir*
		This variable appoints the directory that neocomplcache
		begins to write a file at one time.  When there is not the

		beginning in _ in file type of C/C++.
	
		Because it is complicated, refer to
		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_SameFileTypeLists			*g:NeoComplCache_SameFileTypeLists*
		It is a dictionary to connect file type mutually.  It is
		effective at time to let you refer to c and cpp mutually.
	
		Because it is complicated, refer to
		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

		completion length.
		
		Default value is {}.

g:NeoComplCache_DisableSelectModeMappings		*g:NeoComplCache_DisableSelectModeMappings*
		This variable control whether you invalidate Key-mappings of

		It is the path to the ctags command.
		
		Default value is "ctags".

g:NeoComplCache_CtagsArgumentsList			*g:NeoComplCache_CtagsArgumentsList*
		It is the dictionary of the character string to set a value
		to give as an argument of the commands when buffer_complete
		and include_complete use a ctags command.  The dictionary's
		key is filetype.

		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_IncludePath				*g:NeoComplCache_IncludePath*
		It is the variable to enumerate path of the include file
		every file type.  When there is not it, 'path' is used.
		Refer to 'path' for the description form. It is the
		dictionary of the character string that assumed file type a
		key.
		
		Because it is complicated, refer to
		autoload/neocomplcache/plugin/include_complete.vim for the
		initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_IncludeExpr				*g:NeoComplCache_IncludeExpr*
		It is the expression string of the line analysis to perform
		to acquire an include file name.  When there is not it,
		'includeexpr' is used.  Refer to 'includeexpr' for the

g:NeoComplCache_DisablePluginList			*g:NeoComplCache_DisablePluginList*
		The dictionary which appoints whether you invalidate a
		complete function and plugin.  With a complete function and
		plugin name as a key, it becomes invalid by making a value
		1.  Because neocomplcache refer this option when
		neocomplcache initialize, it is necessary to appoint it
		before initialization.
		
		Default value is {}.

g:NeoComplCache_MemberPrefixPatterns				*g:NeoComplCache_MemberPrefixPatterns*
		This variable appoints a keyword pattern to complete a
		member in include_complete and tags_complete.  This is
		appointed in regular expression every file type.

		keymapping.

neocomplcache#manual_filename_complete				*neocomplcache#manual_filename_complete*
		Use this function on inoremap <expr>.  The keymapping call
		the file name completion of neocomplcache.  When you

PLUGINS					*neocomplcache-plugins*

In this clause, I comment on plug in attached to neocomplcache.
Neocomplcache reads automatically the plugin saved in an
autoload/neocomplcache/plugin directory.

buffer_complete.vim					*buffer_complete*
		This plugin will collect keywords from buffers and
		dictionaries, and to use for completion.  Because the plugin
		offer the basic function of neocomplcache, neocomplcache
		does not work normally when you delete this plugin.

snippets_complete.vim					*snippets_complete*
		This plugin will use snippet files for completion.  The
		plugin offer a function similar with snipMate.vim and
		snippetsEmu.vim.  Because you can search a snippet with a
		function of neocomplcache, you may omit trouble to learn.

tags_complete.vim					*tags_complete*
		This plugin will use a tag file defined in 'tags' for
		completion.  When a huge tag file is set, neocomplcache
		don't make cash if you don't execute
		|:NeoComplCacheCachingTags|command.  Because tags_complete
		is too slow if tags_complete read a big tags file. 
		You should use more convenient include completion now.

syntax_complete.vim					*syntax_complete*
		This plugin will analyze a syntax file like
		autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim offered by default, and to add
		to candidate completion.  The plugin can recognize
		candidates a lot more than autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim.

include_complete.vim					*include_complete*
		This plugin will add the file which an opening buffer refers
		to to candidate.  It is convenient, because you do not need
		to prepare a tags file and a dictionary file.  But it is
		necessary for 'path' and 'include', 'includeexpr' to be set
		adequately.
 
vim_complete.vim					*vim_complete*
		An experimental function. This plugin analyzes context and
		start Omni completion of VimScript.  This plugin does not
		work other than editing time of VimScript.  I made it
		because neocomplcache cannot call |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V|.  It is
		an aim to do to the thing which is higher-performance than
		the completion prepared for by default.  Local variable and
		a script variable, a function and the analysis of the
		command are implemented now.
