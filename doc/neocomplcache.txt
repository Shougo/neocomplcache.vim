INTRODUCTION						*neocomplcache-introduction*

*neocomplcache* performs keyword completion by making a cache of keyword in
buffer. Because I implemented it by paying own expenses unlike the keyword
completion including the Vim composing type, neocomplcache can be customized
flexibly. Unfortunately neocomplcache may use more memory than other
plugins.

							*neocomplcache-version5*
Because all variable names are changed in neocomplcache Ver.5, there is not
backward compatibility. In the case of the upgrade, you should use the next
script which Mr.thinca made.

INTERFACE						*neocomplcache-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 						*neocomplcache-commands*

:NeoComplCacheEnable					*:NeoComplCacheEnable*
		Validate neocomplcache and initialize it.
		Warning: Conventional cache disappears.

:NeoComplCacheDisable					*:NeoComplCacheDisable*
		Invalidate neocomplcache and clean it up.

:NeoComplCacheToggle					*:NeoComplCacheToggle*
		Change a lock state of neocomplcache.
		While locking neocomplcache, automatic completion is not
		possible.

:Neco 							*:Neco*
		Secret.

:NeoComplCacheLock					*:NeoComplCacheLock*
		Lock neocomplcache.
		While locking neocomplcache, manual completion is possible.
		The lock status is buffer local.

:NeoComplCacheUnLock					*:NeoComplCacheUnLock*
		Unlock neocomplcache.

:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength			*:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength*
		Change start length of automatic completion.

:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer*
		Caching [bufname] buffer.  Warning: considerably take time,
		for the big buffer.  Select current buffer when [bufname]
		omitted.  When [bufname] buffer is not cacheed, perform only
		simple cacheing.

:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax [filetype]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax*
		Caching [filetype] syntax file.
		Select current buffer filetype when [filetype] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingDisable [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingDisable*
		Disable [bufname] buffer's cache.
		The cache will be deleted.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingEnable [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheCachingEnable*
		Enable [bufname] buffer's cache.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCachePrintSource [bufname]			*:NeoComplCachePrintSource*
		Output [bufname] buffer's cache in current buffer.
		This command is for debug.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.
		For a command for debugging, a user will not need to use it mainly.

:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword [bufname]			*:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword*
		Write the keyword which cacheed [bufname] buffer in current
		buffer.  Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.  When
		you make a dictionary file by yourself, it may be
		convenient.

		Create tags from [bufname] buffer.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

		Edit [filetype] snippets.  Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted.  When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly.  This
		command edits a snippet file in g:neocomplcache_snippets_dir
		with precedence.  It is done re-cache automatically when you
		store a snippet file.

:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets [filetype]		*:NeoComplCacheEditRuntimeSnippets*
		Edit [filetype] snippets. Edit current buffer's filetype
		snippets when [filetype] omitted. When there is not
		[filetype] snippet file, it is generated newly. This

VARIABLES 						*neocomplcache-variables*

g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup			*g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup*
		This variable controls whether I validate neocomplcache at
		the time of Vim start.  This option should set it in .vimrc.
	
		Because default value is 0, you cannot use neocomplcache
		unless you validate it by manual operation.

g:neocomplcache_max_list				*g:neocomplcache_max_list*
		This variable controls the number of candidates displayed in

		Default value is 100.

g:neocomplcache_max_keyword_width			*g:neocomplcache_max_keyword_width*
		This variable controls the indication width of a candidate
		displayed in a pop-up menu.  The case beyond this value is
		cut down properly.
	
		Default value is 50.

g:neocomplcache_max_filename_width			*g:neocomplcache_max_filename_width*

		at the time of manual completion.  It is convenient when you
		reduce this value, but may get heavy when you deleted a

		For input-saving, this variable controls whether you can
		choose a candidate with a alphabet or number displayed
		beside a candidate after '-'.  When you input 'ho-a',
		neocomplcache will select candidate 'a'.
	
		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_cursor_hold_i			*g:neocomplcache_enable_cursor_hold_i*

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_underbar_completion		*g:neocomplcache_enable_underbar_completion*
		When you input _, this variable controls whether

		an empty character string, it becomes invalid.
	
		Default value is ''.

g:neocomplcache_lock_buffer_name_pattern		*g:neocomplcache_lock_buffer_name_pattern*
		This variable set a pattern of the buffer name. If matched it,

		This variable appoints the pass of the snippet files which
		user defined.  It cuts the directory by plural appointment
		in comma separated value.  When there is not the directory
		which appointed here, neocomplcache will ignore.  User
		defined snippet files are read after having read a normal
		snippet files.  It is overwritten redundant snippet.
	
		There is not this variable unless a user defines it by oneself.

g:neocomplcache_temporary_dir				*g:neocomplcache_temporary_dir*
		This variable appoints the directory that neocomplcache
		begins to write a file at one time.  When there is not the

g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns			*g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns*
		This dictionary records regular expression to recognize a
		keyword pattern of the next than a cursor.  The form is the
		same as|g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns|.

PLUGINS							*neocomplcache-plugins*

In this clause, I comment on plug in attached to neocomplcache.
Neocomplcache reads automatically the plugin saved in an
autoload/neocomplcache/plugin directory.

buffer_complete.vim					*buffer_complete*
		This plugin will collect keywords from buffers and
		dictionaries, and to use for completion.  Because the plugin
		offer the basic function of neocomplcache, neocomplcache
		does not work normally when you delete this plugin.

snippets_complete.vim					*snippets_complete*
		This plugin will use snippet files for completion.  The
		plugin offer a function similar with snipMate.vim and
		snippetsEmu.vim.  Because you can search a snippet with a
		function of neocomplcache, you may omit trouble to learn.

tags_complete.vim					*tags_complete*
		This plugin will use a tag file defined in 'tags' for
		completion.  When a huge tag file is set, neocomplcache
		don't make cache if you don't execute
		|:NeoComplCacheCachingTags|command.  Because tags_complete
		is too slow if tags_complete read a big tags file. 
		You should use more convenient include completion now.

syntax_complete.vim					*syntax_complete*
		This plugin will analyze a syntax file like
		autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim offered by default, and to add
		to candidate completion.  The plugin can recognize
		candidates a lot more than autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim.

include_complete.vim					*include_complete*
		This plugin will add the file which an opening buffer refers
		to to candidate.  It is convenient, because you do not need
		to prepare a tags file and a dictionary file.  But it is
		necessary for 'path' and 'include', 'includeexpr' to be set
		adequately.
 
vim_complete.vim					*vim_complete*
		An experimental function. This plugin analyzes context and
		start Omni completion of VimScript.  This plugin does not
		work other than editing time of VimScript.  I made it
		because neocomplcache cannot call |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V|.  It is
		an aim to do to the thing which is higher-performance than
		the completion prepared for by default.  Local variable and
		a script variable, a function and the analysis of the
		command are implemented now.

dictionary_complete.vim					*dictionary_complete*
		

filename_complete.vim					*filename_complete*
		

omni_complete.vim					*omni_complete*
		

completefunc_complete.vim				*completefunc_complete*
		

spell_complete.vim					*spell_complete*
		

abbrev_complete.vim					*abbrev_complete*
