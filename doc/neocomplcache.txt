INTRODUCTION					*neocomplcache-introduction*

*neocomplcache* is the abbreviation of "neo-completion with cache". It
provides keyword completion system by maintaining a cache of keywords in the
current buffer. neocomplcache could be customized easily and has a lot more
features than the Vim's standard completion feature.
Note: neocomplcache may consume more memory than other plugins.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*neocomplcache-install*

1: Extract the file and put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/ or Program Files/Vim/vimfiles on Windows).
2: Execute |:NeoComplCacheEnable| command or set
let g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup = 1
in your .vimrc.

*neocomplcache-RECOMMENDATION*
						*neocomplcache-asynchronous*
With neocomplcache Ver.6.0 or later, when you have |vimproc| installed,
neocomplcache creates caches asynchronously.

vimproc is distributed at: http://github.com/Shougo/vimproc

To use vimproc, you must compile it.  Refer to the vimproc documentation.

Note: Snippets feature (snippets_complete source), which was originally
      built-in, left since neocomplcache ver.7.
      If you were using it, please install neosnippet source manually.

INTERFACE					*neocomplcache-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*neocomplcache-commands*

:NeoComplCacheEnable				*:NeoComplCacheEnable*
		Validate neocomplcache and initialize it.
		Warning: Conventional cache disappears.

:NeoComplCacheDisable				*:NeoComplCacheDisable*
		Invalidate neocomplcache and clean it up.

:NeoComplCacheToggle				*:NeoComplCacheToggle*
		Change a lock state of neocomplcache.
		While neocomplcache is in locking, you cannot use automatic
		completions.
		Note: This command enables neocomplcache when neocomplcache is
		already disabled.

:Neco [{anim-number}] 				*:Neco*
		Secret.

:NeoComplCacheLock				*:NeoComplCacheLock*
		Lock neocomplcache.
		While neocomplcache is in locking, you cannot use automatic
		completions but can use manual completions.
		The lock status is local to each buffer.
		Note: This command is disabled when neocomplcache is disabled.

:NeoComplCacheUnlock				*:NeoComplCacheUnlock*
		Unlock neocomplcache.
		Note: This command is disabled when neocomplcache is disabled.

:NeoComplCacheLockSource {source-name}		*:NeoComplCacheLockSource*
		Disable {source-name} source completion.  Disable state is
		local to each buffer.

:NeoComplCacheUnlockSource {source-name}	*:NeoComplCacheUnlockSource*
		Unlock {source-name} source completion.

:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength {length}
					*:NeoComplCacheAutoCompletionLength*
		Change start length of automatic completion to {length}.
		Note: This length value is local to each buffer.

:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer [bufname]		*:NeoComplCacheCachingBuffer*
		Cache [bufname] buffer.
		Warning: it may take time considerably for the big buffer.
		This selects current buffer when you omitted [bufname].  When
		[bufname] buffer is not cached, this performs only simple
		caching.  If [bufname] is not loaded, neocomplcache will open
		[bufname] automatically.

:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax [filetype]		*:NeoComplCacheCachingSyntax*
		Caches [filetype] syntax file.
		Selects current buffer filetype when [filetype] is omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingDictionary [filetype]
					*:NeoComplCacheCachingDictionary*
		Caches [filetype] dictionary file.
		Selects current buffer filetype when [filetype] is omitted.

:NeoComplCacheCachingTags		*:NeoComplCacheCachingTags*
		Caches tags file in current buffer.

:NeoComplCacheCachingInclude [bufname]		*:NeoComplCacheCachingInclude*
		Caches [bufname] include file.
		Selects current buffer name when [bufname] is omitted.

:NeoComplCachePrintSource [bufname]		*:NeoComplCachePrintSource*
		Outputs [bufname] buffer's cache in current buffer.
		This command is for debugging.
		Selects current buffer when [bufname] is omitted.
		For a command for debugging, a user will not need to use it
		mainly.

:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword [bufname]		*:NeoComplCacheOutputKeyword*
		Write the keyword which cached [bufname] buffer in current
		buffer.  Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.  When
		you make a dictionary file by yourself, it may be
		convenient.

:NeoComplCacheCreateTags [bufname]		*:NeoComplCacheCreateTags*
		Create tags from [bufname] buffer.
		Select current buffer when [bufname] omitted.

:NeoComplCacheSetFileType [filetype]		*:NeoComplCacheSetFileType*
		Change filetype to [filetype] in current buffer.
		This filetype is only used neocomplcache.
		Note: You can get current filetype by
		|neocomplcache#get_context_filetype()|

:NeoComplCacheClean 				*:NeoComplCacheClean*
		Clean cache files in |g:neocomplcache_temporary_dir|.

VARIABLES 					*neocomplcache-variables*

g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup
					*g:neocomplcache_enable_at_startup*
		Neocomplcache gets started automatically when Vim starts if
		this value is 1.

		With the default value 0, you cannot use neocomplcache
		unless you start it manually.

g:neocomplcache_manual_completion_start_length
			*g:neocomplcache_manual_completion_start_length*
		This variable controls the number of the input completion
		at the time of manual completion.  It is convenient when you
		reduce this value, but may get heavy when you deleted a
		letter in <C-h> or <BS> at popup indication time.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_min_keyword_length
					*g:neocomplcache_min_keyword_length*

		Default value is 'ignorecase'.

g:neocomplcache_enable_smart_case
					*g:neocomplcache_enable_smart_case*
		When a capital letter is included in input, neocomplcache does
		not ignore the upper- and lowercase.

		Default value is 'infercase'.

g:neocomplcache_disable_auto_complete

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_wildcard
					*g:neocomplcache_enable_wildcard*
		This variable controls whether neocomplcache accept wild
		card character '*' for input-saving.

		|g:neocomplcache_wildcard_characters|.

		Default value is 1.

g:neocomplcache_enable_cursor_hold_i
					*g:neocomplcache_enable_cursor_hold_i*
		This variable controls whether neocomplcache use |CursorHoldI|
		event when complete candidates.
		Note: You should not use this option if less than Vim 7.3.418.
		Note: This option must be set before call |:NeoComplCacheEnable|.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_cursor_hold_i_time
					*g:neocomplcache_cursor_hold_i_time*
		If g:neocomplcache_enable_cursor_hold_i is non-zero and in

		Default value is 300.

g:neocomplcache_enable_insert_char_pre
				*g:neocomplcache_enable_insert_char_pre*
		This variable controls whether neocomplcache use
		|InsertCharPre| event when complete candidates.
		Note: You should not use this option if less than Vim 7.3.461.
		Note: This option must be set before call
		|:NeoComplCacheEnable|.
		Note: This option is experimental.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_auto_select
					*g:neocomplcache_enable_auto_select*
		When neocomplcache displays candidates, this option controls
		whether neocomplcache selects the first candidate
		automatically.  If you enable this option, neocomplcache's
		completion behavior is like |AutoComplPop|.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_auto_delimiter
				*g:neocomplcache_enable_auto_delimiter*
		This option controls whether neocomplcache insert delimiter
		automatically.  For example, /(filename) or #(Vim script).

				*g:neocomplcache_enable_camel_case_completion*
		When you input a capital letter, this variable controls
		whether neocomplcache takes an ambiguous searching as an end
		of the words in it.  For example, neocomplcache comes to match
		it with "ArgumentsException" when you input it with "AE".

		Note: This feature may be too slow.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_underbar_completion
				*g:neocomplcache_enable_underbar_completion*
		When you input _, this variable controls whether
		neocomplcache takes an ambiguous searching as an end of the
		words in it.  For example, neocomplcache come to match it
		with "public_html" when you input it with "p_h".

		Note: This feature may be too slow.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_enable_fuzzy_completion
				*g:neocomplcache_enable_fuzzy_completion*
		When you input one character, this variable controls whether
		neocomplcache takes an ambiguous searching as an end of the

		"public_html" or "PublicHtml" when you input it with "puh".

		Note: If you enable it,
		|g:neocomplcache_enable_underbar_completion| and
		|g:neocomplcache_enable_camel_case_completion| is disabled.

		Note: If |g:neocomplcache_fuzzy_completion_start_length| is 3,
		"ph" does not complete "public_html".

		Note: This match is too heavy.  So, it is enabled when your
		input length is longer than or equal to
		|g:neocomplcache_fuzzy_completion_start_length| and less than
		20 characters.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_fuzzy_completion_start_length
			*g:neocomplcache_fuzzy_completion_start_length*
		It controls length of fuzzy completion start length.  For
		example, if this variable is "3", third and after input
		characters are fuzzy matched.  But first and second input
		characters are not fuzzy matched.
		Note: If this variable changed, completion speed may be too
		slow.

		Default value is 3.

g:neocomplcache_enable_caching_message

		displays the message in Command-line.

		Default value is 1.

g:neocomplcache_caching_limit_file_size
				*g:neocomplcache_caching_limit_file_size*
		This variable set file size to make a cache of a file.  If
		open file is bigger than this size, neocomplcache does not
		make a cache.

		Default value is 500000.

g:neocomplcache_disable_caching_file_path_pattern
			*g:neocomplcache_disable_caching_file_path_pattern*
		This variable set a pattern of the buffer file path.  If
		matched it, neocomplcache does not save a cache of the buffer.
		When it is an empty character string, neocomplcache will
		ignore.

		Default value is ''.

g:neocomplcache_lock_buffer_name_pattern
				*g:neocomplcache_lock_buffer_name_pattern*
		This variable set a pattern of the buffer name.  If matched it,
		neocomplcache does not complete automatically.  When it is an
		empty character string, neocomplcache will ignore.

		Default value is ''.

g:neocomplcache_compare_function	*g:neocomplcache_compare_function*
		This variable set compare candidates function.
		The compare function specification is same to |sort()|
		compare function.  If you change compare function, you must
		create compare function.

		Default value is 'neocomplcache#compare_rank'.

g:neocomplcache_enable_prefetch		*g:neocomplcache_enable_prefetch*
		This variable controls whether neocomplcache prefetches.  If
		this variable is non-zero, neocomplcache does not flick in auto
		completion.

		Note: This variable has a side effect.  Partial function (ex:
		|complete_check()|) is disabled in completefunc.
		Note: If this variable is 0, an input problem may occur in
		using uim-skk or other IMEs on GVim.

		Default value is 0 (above or equal to 7.3.519.)
		Default value is 1 (|+xim| and GUI version.)

g:neocomplcache_lock_iminsert		*g:neocomplcache_lock_iminsert*
		If this variable is non-zero, neocomplcache locks when
		'iminsert' is non-zero.

		Default value is 0.

g:neocomplcache_temporary_dir		*g:neocomplcache_temporary_dir*
		This variable appoints the directory that neocomplcache
		begins to write a file at one time.  When there is not the
		directory which appointed here, it is made.  For example,
		buffer_complete.vim stores cache of the keyword in this
		'buffer_cache' sub directory.

		Default value is '~/.neocomplcache'.

g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns
					*g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns*
		This dictionary records keyword patterns to completion.
		This is appointed in regular expression every file type.
		If the key is "_" or "default", it is used for default
		pattern.

		Because it is complicated, refer to neocomplcache#enable() in
		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:neocomplcache_next_keyword_patterns
				*g:neocomplcache_next_keyword_patterns*
		This dictionary records regular expression to recognize a
		keyword pattern of the next than a cursor.  The form is the
		same as |g:neocomplcache_keyword_patterns|.

		Because it is complicated, refer to neocomplcache#enable() in
		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns		*g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns*
		This dictionary records keyword patterns used in
		|omni_complete|.  This is appointed in regular expression
		every file type or 'omnifunc' name.  If this pattern is not
		defined or empty pattern, neocomplcache does not call
		'omnifunc'.
		Note: ruby and php omnifunc are disabled, because they are too
		slow.
		Note: Partial omnifunc has problem when neocomplcache call(Ex:
		rubycomplete, jedi.vim, cocoa.vim and clang_complete).  You should
		|g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns| instead.

		Because it is complicated, refer to s:source.initialize()
		autoload/neocomplcache/sources/omni_complete.vim for the
		initial value.

		If this pattern is not defined or empty pattern, neocomplcache
		does not call 'omnifunc'.
		Note: If it is a set, neocomplcache will call 'omnifunc' or
		|g:neocomplcache_omni_functions| directly.  So almost
		neocomplcache features are disabled.  But all Omni completion
		works instead of |g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns|.

g:neocomplcache_tags_filter_patterns
					*g:neocomplcache_tags_filter_patterns*
		This dictionary records a pattern to filter a candidate in
		the tag completion.  For example, it can exclude a candidate
		beginning in _ in file type of C/C++.

g:neocomplcache_same_filetype_lists
				*g:neocomplcache_same_filetype_lists*
		It is a dictionary to connect file type mutually.  It is
		effective at time to let you refer to c and cpp mutually.
		The value are comma-separated filetypes.
		If the value contains "_", neocomplcache completes from all
		buffers.  If the key is "_", the value will be used for default
		same filetypes.

		It is a dictionary to connect a dictionary file with file
		type.  The dictionary's key is filetype and comma-separated
		multiple value is a path to a dictionary file.  If this

					*g:neocomplcache_text_mode_filetypes*
		It is a dictionary to define text mode filetypes.  The
		dictionary's key is filetype and value is number.  If the
		value is non-zero, this filetype is text mode.  In text mode,
		neocomplcache supports word conversion to write English.

		For example, if you input "Fo", neocomplcache will convert
		candidate "foo" to "Foo".  If you input "foo", neocomplcache
		will convert candidate "FooBar" to "foobar".  If you input
		"FO", neocomplcache will convert candidate "foo" to "FOO".
		Note: Text mode conversion is only used for "foobar" or

					*g:neocomplcache_ctags_arguments_list*
		It is the dictionary of the character string to set a value
		to give as an argument of the commands when buffer_complete
		and include_complete use a ctags command.  The dictionary's
		key is filetype.  If the key is "_", it will be used for
		default.

		Because it is complicated, refer to neocomplcache#enable() in
		autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:neocomplcache_include_paths		*g:neocomplcache_include_paths*
		It is the variable to enumerate path of the include file
		every file type.  When there is not it, 'path' is used.

		initial value.

g:neocomplcache_include_exprs			*g:neocomplcache_include_exprs*
		It is the expression string of the line analysis to perform
		to acquire an include file name.  When there is not it,
		'includeexpr' is used.  Refer to 'includeexpr' for the
		description form.  It is the dictionary of the character
		string that assumed file type a key.

		Because it is complicated, refer to s:source.initialize() in

SOURCES						*neocomplcache-sources*

Neocomplcache reads automatically sources saved in an
autoload/neocomplcache/sources directory.

buffer_complete.vim				*buffer_complete*
		This source collects keywords from buffer.

member_complete.vim				*member_complete*
		This source collects use of member variables from buffer.

tags_complete.vim				*tags_complete*
		This source analyzes a tag file from tagfiles() for completion.
		When a huge tag file (above
		|g:neocomplcache_tags_caching_limit_file_size|) is set,
		neocomplcache does not make cache if you do not execute
		|:NeoComplCacheCachingTags|command.  Because tags_complete is
		too slow if tags_complete read a big tags file.  You should use
		more convenient include completion now.

syntax_complete.vim				*syntax_complete*
		This source analyzes a syntax file like
		autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim offered by default, and to
		add to candidate completion.  The plugin can recognize
		candidates a lot more than autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim.

include_complete.vim				*include_complete*
		This source will add the file which an opening buffer
		refers to to candidate.  It is convenient, because you do
		not need to prepare a tags file and a dictionary file.
		But it is necessary for 'path' and 'include',
		'includeexpr' to be set adequately.

		Note: If you have vimproc installed, neocomplcache will cache
		automatically.  Otherwise it won't; please execute
		|:NeoComplCacheCachingInclude| manually.

vim_complete.vim				*vim_complete*
		This source analyzes context and start Omni completion of
		Vim script.  This plugin does not work other than editing
		time of Vim script.  I created it because neocomplcache
		cannot call |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-V|.  Local variable and a
		script variable, a function and the analysis of the
		command are implemented now.

dictionary_complete.vim				*dictionary_complete*
		This source adds candidates from 'dictionary' or
		|g:neocomplcache_dictionary_filetype_lists|.

filename_complete.vim				*filename_complete*
		This source collects filename candidates.

filename_include.vim				*filename_include*
		This source collects filename candidates.  It is useful
		when you input header file name.  It recognizes include
		pattern and include path like include_complete.

omni_complete.vim				*omni_complete*
		This source calls 'omnifunc' automatically when cursor
		text is matched with |g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns|.  If
		|g:neocomplcache_omni_function_list|is defined,
		neocomplcache will give priority it.
		Note: This source is not supported wildcard.

FAQ						*neocomplcache-faq*

Q: Is there a way to control the colors used for popup menu using highlight
groups?:

A: Like this:
>
	highlight Pmenu ctermbg=8 guibg=#606060
	highlight PmenuSel ctermbg=1 guifg=#dddd00 guibg=#1f82cd
	highlight PmenuSbar ctermbg=0 guibg=#d6d6d6
<

Q: Python (or Ruby) interface crashes Vim when I use neocomplcache or not
responding when input ".":

A: This is not neocomplcache's issue.  Please report to the maintainers of the
omnicomplete (rubycomplete or pythoncomplete) and its Vim interface.  You
should disable omni_complete in python or ruby.
>

	  let g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns = {}
	endif
	let g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns.python = ''
	let g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns.ruby = ''
<

Q: I like moving cursor by cursor-keys.  But neocomplcache popups menus...

A: Please set this in your .vimrc.  Note that this feature requires Vim 7.3.418
or later.
>
	let g:neocomplcache_enable_insert_char_pre = 1
<

Q: Where is snippets set for neocomplcache?

A: https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet


Q: How I can disable python omni complete of neocomplcache?:

A:
>
	if !exists('g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns')
	  let g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns = {}
	endif
	let g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns.python = ''
<

Q: Can I enable quick match? :

A: Quick match feature had been removed in latest neocomplcache
because quick match turned into hard to implement.
But you can use |unite.vim| instead to use quick match.
>
	imap <expr> -  pumvisible() ?
	    \ "\<Plug>(neocomplcache_start_unite_quick_match)" : '-'
<

Q: How can I change the order of candidates? :

A: The default compare function is rank order.  It sorts rank order and
alphabetical order.  If you select candidates, the candidate's rank will be
high.  To change compare function, you can change
|g:neocomplcache_compare_function| value.
Note: To use rank feature, your Vim's version must be 7.3.549 or above.
>
	let g:neocomplcache_compare_function = 'neocomplcache#compare_word'
<
To make new compare function, please refer |g:neocomplcache_compare_function|.

The built-in compare functions:
	neocomplcache#compare_rank        : Rank order (default)
	neocomplcache#compare_word        : Alphabetical order
	neocomplcache#compare_human       : Human order(slow)
	neocomplcache#compare_nothing     : Do not sort


Q: An input problem occurred in using uim-skk or other IMEs:

A: It may be fixed with setting |g:neocomplcache_enable_prefetch| as 1.


Q: include_complete does not work.

A: include_complete depends on |vimproc|.  I recommend you to install it.  Also
you can check 'path' option or change |g:neocomplcache_include_paths|.

http://github.com/Shougo/vimproc


Q: An error occurred in "sudo vim":

A: neocomplcache does not support "sudo vim".  Because neocomplcache (and other
plugins) creates temporary files in super user permission by sudo command.  You
must use sudo.vim or set "Defaults always_set_home" in "/etc/sudoers", or must
use "sudoedit" command.

Ubuntu has a command "sudoedit" which can work well with neocomplcache.
I'm not sure if other distros has this command...

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=729


Q: Error occurred in ruby omni complete using |g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns|.
https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/issues/95

A: Please set |g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns| instead of
|g:neocomplcache_omni_patterns|.

Q: Does not work with clang_complete.

A: Please try below settings.

Q: I want to support omni patterns for external plugins.

A: You can add find some already found omni patterns and functions at here.

Note: Some patterns are omitted here, (someone should check out those plugin's
source code's complete function, and find out the omni pattern).
>

	let g:neocomplcache_omni_functions.javascript = 'jscomplete#CompleteJS'

<

Q: Does not indent when I input "else" in ruby filetype.

A:

You must install "vim-ruby" from github to indent in neocomplcache first.
https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby

Neocomplcache pops up a completion window automatically, but if the popup
window is already visible, Vim cannot indent text.  So you must choose "close
popup window manually by <C-y> or <C-e> mappings" or "close popup window by
<CR> user mappings".

Q: <CR> mapping conflicts with |SuperTab| or |endwise| plugins.

A: Please try below settings.
>
	" <CR>: close popup and save indent.
	inoremap <silent> <CR> <C-r>=<SID>my_cr_function()<CR>
	function! s:my_cr_function()
	  return neocomplcache#smart_close_popup() . "\<CR>"
	  " For no inserting <CR> key.
	  "return pumvisible() ? neocomplcache#close_popup() : "\<CR>"
	endfunction
>
Q: No completion offered from "vim" buffers in "non-vim" buffers.

A: It is feature. neocomplcache completes from same filetype buffers in
default.  But you can completes from other filetype buffers using
|g:neocomplcache_same_filetype_lists|.

Q: Suggestions are case insensitive in "gitcommit" buffers, but not
"javascript".

A: This is g:neocomplcache_text_mode_filetypes feature.
You can disable it by following code.
>
	if !exists('g:neocomplcache_text_mode_filetypes')
	  let g:neocomplcache_tags_filter_patterns = {}
	endif
	let g:neocomplcache_text_mode_filetypes.gitcommit = 0
<
Q: Conflicts completefunc with other plugins in neocomplcache.

A: You can disable the error by |g:neocomplcache_force_overwrite_completefunc|
variable to 1.

Q: I want to use Ruby omni_complete.

A: Please set |g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns|.  But this completion is
heavy, so disabled by default.
>
	if !exists('g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns')
	  let g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns = {}
	endif
	let g:neocomplcache_force_omni_patterns.ruby = '[^. *\t]\.\w*\|\h\w*::'
<
Q: I want to use jedi omni_complete.
https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim

A: Please set |g:neocomplcache_omni_functions| as below.
>
	if !exists('g:neocomplcache_omni_functions')
	    let g:neocomplcache_omni_functions = {}
	endif
	let g:neocomplcache_omni_functions.python = 'jedi#complete'
	let g:jedi#popup_on_dot = 0
<
Q: Candidates are not found in heavy completion(neco-look, etc).

A: It may be caused by skip completion.


Q: I want to disable skip completion.

A:
>
	let g:neocomplcache_skip_auto_completion_time = ''
<
Q: I want to initialize neocomplcache in .vimrc.

A: Please call neocomplcache#initialize() in .vimrc.  But this function slows
your Vim initialization.
>
	call neocomplcache#initialize()
<
Q: neocomplcache conflicts when multibyte input in GVim.

A: Because Vim multibyte IME integration is incomplete.
If you set |g:neocomplcache_lock_iminsert| is non-zero, it may be fixed.

Q: Freeze for a while and close opened folding when I begin to insert.
https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache/issues/368

A: I think you use 'foldmethod' is "expr" or "syntax". It is too heavy to use
neocomplcache(or other auto completion). You should change 'foldmethod'
option.
Note: In current version, neocomplcache does not restore 'foldmethod'. Because
it is too heavy.
