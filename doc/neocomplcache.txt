INTRODUCTION					*neocomplcache-introduction*

*neocomplcache* performs keyword completion by making a cash of keyword in buffer.
Because I implemented it by paying own expenses unlike the keyword completion
including the Vim composing type, neocomplcache can be customized flexibly.
Unfortunately neocomplcache may use more memory than other plugins.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*neocomplcache-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		In syntax files, this variable controls length of keyword becoming
		the object of the completion at the minimum.
	
		Default value is 4.

g:NeoComplCache_IgnoreCase				*g:NeoComplCache_IgnoreCase*
		When neocomplcache looks for candidate completion, this variable controls

g:NeoComplCache_SkipInputTime				*g:NeoComplCache_SkipInputTime*
		This variable defines continuation input time to cancel automatic completion by a second unit.
		This optional value must be character string.
	
		Because the default value is '0.0', neocomplcache doesn't cancel completion by the consecutive input.

g:NeoComplCache_PreviousKeywordCompletion		*g:NeoComplCache_PreviousKeywordCompletion*

		Default value is '~/.neocon'.

g:NeoComplCache_KeywordPatterns				*g:NeoComplCache_KeywordPatterns*
		This dictionary records keyword patterns to completion.
		This is appointed in regular expression every file type.

		Because it is complicated, refer to autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_OmniPatterns				*g:NeoComplCache_OmniPatterns*
		This dictionary records keyword patterns to Omni completion.
		This is appointed in regular expression every file type.
		When you customize it, you must use '\v' for the top of the pattern.

g:NeoComplCache_SameFileTypeLists			*g:NeoComplCache_SameFileTypeLists*
		It is a dictionary to connect file type mutually.
		It is effective at time to let you refer to c and cpp mutually.
	
		Because it is complicated, refer to autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_NonBufferFileTypeDetect			*g:NeoComplCache_NonBufferFileTypeDetect*
		It is a dictionary to connect file type with extension.
		When neocomplcache cannot judge file type well, dictionary files are effective.
	
		Because it is complicated, refer to autoload/neocomplcache.vim for the initial value.

g:NeoComplCache_DictionaryFileTypeLists			*g:NeoComplCache_DictionaryFileTypeLists*
		It is a dictionary to connect a dictionary file with file type.
		The dictionary's key is filetype and value is a path to a dictionary file.

PLUGINS					*neocomplcache-plugins*

In this clause, I comment on plug in attached to neocomplcache.
Neocomplcache reads automatically the plugin saved in an autoload/neocomplcache directory.

keyword_complete.vim					*keyword_complete*
		This plugin will collect keywords from buffers and dictionaries, and to use for completion.
		Because the plugin offer the basic function of neocomplcache,
		neocomplcache does not work normally when you delete this plugin.

snippets_complete.vim					*snippets_complete*
		This plugin will use snippet files for completion.
		The plugin offer a function similar with snipMate.vim and snippetsEmu.vim.
		Because you can search a snippet with a function of neocomplcache,
		you may omit trouble to learn.

tags_complete.vim					*tags_complete*
		This plugin will use a tag file defined in 'tags' for completion.
		Because the plugin is slow if a tag file is big, I work only by manual completion.
		If NeoComplCache_EnableInfo is 1, the plugin will display the additional information.

syntax_complete.vim					*syntax_complete*
		This plugin will analyze a syntax file like autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim offered by default,
		and to add to candidate completion.
		The plugin can recognize candidates a lot more than autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim.

BUGS						*neocomplcache-bugs*

CREATE PLUGIN					*neocomplcache-create-plugin*

In this clause, I comment on a method to make plugin of neocomplcache.
The ability of neocomplcache will spread by creating plugin by yourself.
